### Plot

Synopsis of A Song of Ice and Fire and World of A Song of Ice and Fire
Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

### Theme

The series has been praised by both television critics and historians for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R. R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.Martin has said that, "the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies.

library(ggplot2)
GOT <- data.frame(
  Season = c("1- 2011", "2- 2012", "3- 2013", "4- 2014", "5- 2015", "6- 2016", "7- 2017", "8- 2019"), Avg_Viewers_Per_Season_mill = c(2.52, 3.8, 4.97, 6.84, 6.88, 7.69, 10.26, 11.99))

### **Review of Viewership**

From the graph above, we can see a constant increase in viewership after each season. Between when the first season was aired in 2011 and when the last season was aired in 2019, there has been a percentage increase of 375.4%. Some interesting insight shows that the percentage change in viewings between 2011 and 2012 is the highest among all the years, indicating a significant increase in viewership in that year. Which shows that after people realized how nice the series was, more people got interested and decided to be a part of it. Meanwhile, the percentage change in viewings between 2014 and 2015 is the lowest, suggesting nothing major really happened in season 4. The overall trend shows an increase in viewings over time, with some fluctuations in growth rate.
